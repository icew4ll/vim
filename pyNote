# try vs if {{{
1) Use try if 99% time expects no exception
2) Use if exceptions expected  more than 50% time
if you expect that 99 % of the time result will actually contain something
iterable, I'd use the try/except approach. It will be faster if exceptions
really are exceptional. If result is None more than 50 % of the time, then
using if is probably better.
